# Integration Tests in Rust 

This repository provides a comprehensive example of different types of testing in Rust using the [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manager. The application demonstrates writing unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests.

This example includes a Rust application with a simple module (src/lib.rs) containing unit tests, integration tests in a separate file (tests/pizzas.rs), and documentation tests embedded in the Rust doc comments.

## Features

- Writing and running unit tests.
- Creating and executing integration tests.
- Incorporating documentation tests for comprehensive testing coverage.

## Getting Started

   ```

3. Build the application using Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Usage
